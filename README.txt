The manual lecture-timetable scheduling demands considerable time and efforts.

The lecture-timetablescheduling is a Constraint satisfaction problem in which we find a solution that satisfies thegiven set of constraints.

A college timetable is a temporal arrangement of a set of lectures and classrooms in which allgiven constraints are satisfied.

Creating such timetables manually is complex and time-consuming process. By automating this process with computer assisted timetable generatorcan save a lot of precious time of administrators who are involved in creating and managingcourse timetables.
